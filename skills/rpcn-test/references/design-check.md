# Design check

Step 2 uses section 1 to decide whether the note counts. Do the rest once
per pipeline, after the unit tests. The Design check reads
the pipeline (and `<res>`) against three sections of its design note:
Error handling, Delivery and ordering, and Idempotency (AD-7). The note's
format is `design-format.md` (in this folder).

The note is read only ("Who writes what" in `design-format.md`): never edit
it, never write or edit a Deviations row, and never suggest that rpcn-test
does. Recording a departure is rpcn-author's job. Never edit the pipeline
either (AD-6), and never run it against an outside service for this check:
it is a reading of the YAML.

## 1. When the note counts

Step 2's `hash --check <dir>/<name>.design.md` decides:

- **Exit 2, file not found:** no note. The section is
  `Not run: no design note.` and the note is not an input.
- **Exit 0, `data.ready: true`:** read the note and check each item of the
  Readiness list in `design-format.md`. All pass: the note is ready, and it
  is the last `hash` input. It is recorded in the report's `inputs` as
  `<name>.design.md` (bare, relative to the report's folder) only when the
  Design check ran (it wrote rows); with any `Not run` line it is not.
- **Anything else** (draft, stale, malformed, or a Readiness item fails,
  such as a `[blocking]` open decision): not ready. The section is
  `Not run: design note not ready (<reason>).`, the note is not an input,
  and a line saying why goes in `open_questions` (headless) or the reply. It
  never makes the run `blocked`.

When the note counts, the check runs even when lint has errors: it reads
the YAML, not the binary. Only when the YAML does not parse at all (a
`yaml: line <n>: …` lint error) is the section
`Not run: the pipeline does not parse.`, and the note is not an input.

## 2. What to look for

Read each section's text, then look for what it asks for in the pipeline
and `<res>`, at any depth (inside `fallback`, `switch`, `broker`, `catch`,
`try`, `branch` and the like):

- **Error handling:** the retries and their count (`retries`,
  `max_retries`, a `retry` output or processor), the routing of a failed
  message (`fallback`, `catch`, a `switch` on `errored()`), the DLQ
  destination it names (the topic, table or path, on the last `fallback`
  entry or the error branch), and any drop (`drop`, `drop_on`, a `catch`
  that deletes the message). A message the section says goes to a DLQ that
  the pipeline drops or logs and drops is a departure.
- **Delivery and ordering:** an ordering requirement (per key, per
  partition) against an output `max_in_flight` above 1, a `broker` or
  parallel output, batching that reorders, or `parallel` and similar
  processors on that path. A drop the Error handling section rules out is
  counted there, not here.
- **Idempotency:** the dedupe key it names (such as `id`) kept on every
  output path: no mapping on any path removes or rewrites it, and a key or
  ID field it says the sink uses (`key`, `id`, a header) is set from it.

Count each departure once, under the section that makes the choice (as
rpcn-author records it): a missing DLQ is an `Error handling` finding only.

A section that asks for nothing the pipeline can be checked against is
`ok`, and its finding says why: `None.`, "no ordering requirement", or a
job of the outside service (such as "the fulfilment API deduplicates on
`id`", where the pipeline only has to keep `id`, so check that).

## 3. One row per section

Write one row per section, in the note's order (Error handling, Delivery
and ordering, Idempotency): `section` (the heading), `finding` (what the
pipeline does, in one or two short sentences, naming the fields, such as
"Retries 3 times, then `fallback` to `orders.dlq`"), `result`.

For each departure, read the note's Deviations table:

- a row with that `section` (exactly the heading) and `resolved: no` that
  describes this departure covers it: `deviation-recorded`, with the row's
  `what`, word for word, in `finding`
- no such row, or only `resolved: yes` rows: `mismatch`

When a section has several findings, `finding` names them all and the
worst result wins: `mismatch`, then `deviation-recorded`, then `ok`.

The Summary line is
`Design check: <o> ok, <d> deviation-recorded, <m> mismatch` (the rows of
each result), or `Design check: not run` for any `Not run`.

A `mismatch` makes the verdict `fail` and `checks.tests` `fail`. A
`deviation-recorded` row affects neither.

## 4. A fix for each mismatch

Each `mismatch` gets one Proposed changes item:

- its title names the section, such as "Send failed orders to `orders.dlq`
  after the retries, as Error handling says (Error handling)"
- one line, with the words `Deviations row`, saying that keeping the
  departure instead means having rpcn-author record a Deviations row for it
  in the note
- a `diff` block against the pipeline (or `<res>`) that makes it do what
  the section says

Write the whole fixed pipeline (with every lint fix too) to the Step 4 temp
path and check it as `fix-check.md` says. A fix to `<res>` writes the fixed
`<res>` copy, under the same file name, to the same temp folder, and that
lint passes `--resources` set to that copy. End the item's title with
`(unverified)` when lint can't confirm it, or when it can't be checked.
